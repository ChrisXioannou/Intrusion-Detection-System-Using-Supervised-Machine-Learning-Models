## üîç **Abstract**
The growing complexity of cyber threats has necessitated the development of **innovative solutions** to protect modern networks. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** have long been a cornerstone of cybersecurity, designed to monitor and detect **anomalous activities**. However, they are often associated with **moderate detection accuracy and high false alarm rates**, particularly when encountering complex or novel attack patterns. This underscores the need for **further experimentation and refinement**.

This research explores the application of **machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection** using the **KDD Cup 1999 dataset**, aiming to classify network traffic into different categories, distinguishing between **normal activity and various types of malicious threats**. In addition to evaluating **multi-class classification**, a **binary classification approach** was also examined to determine whether simplifying the detection process improves overall reliability.

These insights emphasize the importance of **selecting models based on IDS deployment needs**. Additionally, this study highlights key challenges such as **high false positive rates, imbalanced class distributions, and the necessity for continuous adaptation** in cybersecurity. Addressing these issues is crucial for developing **adaptive and proactive network security strategies**, strengthening the role of **machine learning in modern IDS implementations**.
